        "\n",
        "The Iris, a type of flowering plant, was extensively studied by botanist Edgar Anderson in the Gaspé Peninsula, where he documented various characteristics of numerous iris flowers in a digital format. This dataset gained recognition following its use by biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper, *The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems*. Fisher leveraged this dataset to illustrate the applicability of statistics in classification tasks. He suggested that distinct attributes among the species in this dataset, particularly sepal and petal measurements, could serve as reliable indicators for the identification of different iris groups.   For these reasons the Iris dataset is popular within Data Science and Machine Learning communities. It's often likened to the \"Hello World\" program of programming but in the context of data science.\n",

        "The objective of this report is to explore the hypothesis that this dataset can be utilized for species classification, and to elucidate the reasons for its popularity among the Data Science and Machine Learning communities.\n",

        "From Table 3 we can see the following:\n",
        "* Mean values show that sepal and petal lengths are larger than their respective width measurements and that sepals run larger than petals. So, if we had never seen an iris flower before, we can assume from these figures that petals are smaller than sepals and that both are generally longer than they are wide.\n",
        "* The mean and median values of both sepal measurements are quite similar and the low standard deviations [4] suggest this data may be quite clustered together with datapoints relatively close to the mean. \n",
        "* On the other hand, the mean and median values of both petal measurements are not as close and petal standard deviations are slightly higher than their sepal counterparts, suggesting that there is more variance in the petal data.\n",
        "* The previous two observations suggest that any differences between iris species may be more likely related to petal features rather than sepal.\n",
        "\n",
        "From Figure 1 we see that iris setosa (blue) appears visually to be quite separate from the other two species in virtually all scatter plot feature combinations, but most drastically in petal measurements. While there is quite a bit of observable overlap between versicolor (orange) and virginica (green), particularly in terms of sepal measurements, setosa appears to be significantly linearly distinct. Petal length and width and sepal length in the setosa are significantly smaller than those of either versicolor or virginica, as we can see in the histograms where the setosa data is much closer to the left of each graph.    \n",
        "\n",
        "Also, although versicolor and virginica are not cleanly distinct from one another, again the petal measurements demonstrate a pattern with virginica tending to have longer and wider petals than versicolor. Sepal measurements for these species are much more clustered when examined alone but when paired with petal measurements, distinctions can be seen as those with larger petals seemingly tend to also have larger sepals.\n",
        "\n",
        "From Table 3 we can see that:\n",
        "* Petal length and width are very highly positively correlated (r = 0.96), which tells us that as one gets larger so does the other, indicating that petal length and width have a close relationship.\n",
        "* On the other hand, sepal measurements have a very weak relationship with one another (r = -0.1).\n",
        "* Both petal length and width have very strong positive correlations with sepal length (r = 0.87 and 0.82 respectively) indicating that as both get larger, so does sepal length.\n",
        "* Both petal length and width have fairly weak negative correlations with sepal width (r = -0.42 and -0.36 respectively) indicating there is not much of a relationship between these features. \n",
        "* These correlations tell us that sepal width is not moderately or highly correlated with any other measurement.\n",

        "    * If measurements are presented of an iris with short, narrow petals and short but wide sepals, it could be reliably predicted that the particular species is setosa.\n",
        "* Species differentiation largely depends more on petal measurements than sepal measurements.\n",
